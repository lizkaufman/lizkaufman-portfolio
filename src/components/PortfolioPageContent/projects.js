      "For our School of Code final project, we were tasked with creating an app that helps match volunteers with organisations and opportunities. As a team of three, we created Volt, a progressive web app that uses dating app functionality to match volunteers and organisations for a long-term volunteering relationship. I made the personality quiz and matching interface, ensured the app was responsive for both mobile and computer users, and designed the fully RESTful API on the back end.",

      "For our School of Code mid-term project, our team of four received a brief from the West Midlands Combined Authority to create an interactive page for their tree-planting initiative. In one week, we built a single-page application that shows trees planted on a map of the WCMA key areas and records new trees planted and requests for trees. I designed functional components/logic, linked the front end to PostgreSQL database tables on the back end, and ensured the page was responsive on web, tablet, and mobile.",

    summary:
      "This project began as a pair programming project during week 10 of School of Code: translate a well-known game into a React app. We chose hangman with a code-themed twist. At the end of the week, we had a functioning one-player game, with a bank of ten React-themed words, one of which is chosen randomly and guessed by the player. I enjoyed working on this so much that I've made my own repo of it to keep tinkering with it further. I'm planning, as a personal project, to make it two-player with socket.io.",

      "At the end of the day that we were first introduced to GatsbyJS, we had a one-hour hackathon to try it out and make something. This was of course during the global circumstances that led to a toilet paper calculator going viral, so our group decided to make something similar, but for beer. It might not be quite as critical as loo roll, but it's good for morale!",
